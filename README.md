# FoodForThought
Have you ever felt like going out for food? You think of what you can get. 
You went to that pizza place last week, you're really not in the mood for sushi, and that bar was just bad.
You google places to eat, but that always comes up with the same 3 or 4 restaraunts every time.
Food For Thought is how you will solve this conundrum, select a few different options and we'll immediately give you a new place to try!
It even includes options for diets, so those of you on keto or gluten free can easily find something to suit your needs!
